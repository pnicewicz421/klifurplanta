### Tasks
| ID | Description | Status | Complexity | Priority |
|----|-------------|--------|------------|----------|
| KLIF-1001 | Create larger procedural map system - Expand from current small levels to larger, more complex mountainous terrain. Implement procedural generation for varied climbing challenges with different terrain types (ice, rock, snow, etc.) | ðŸ“‹ | High | P0 |
| KLIF-1002 | Implement ice axe terrain interaction - Add gameplay mechanic where players can use ice axes from inventory to cut through ice terrain tiles. Make challenging but not impossible - balance difficulty appropriately | ðŸ“‹ | Medium | P0 |
| KLIF-1003 | Replace blob sprites with proper 2D art - Design and implement proper 2D sprites for player character (~50x30px), terrain tiles, items, and NPCs. Create sprite sheets and animation systems for character movement | ðŸ“‹ | High | P1 |
| KLIF-1004 | Build NPC and dialogue system - Create NPC entities with conversation components. Implement dialogue trees, party invitation mechanics (with rejection/acceptance rates), and NPC AI behaviors for mountaineering scenarios | âœ… | High | P1 |

| KLIF-1007 | Enhance stamina consumption mechanics - Refine existing stamina system to vary consumption based on terrain difficulty, equipment weight, weather conditions, and climbing techniques used | ðŸ“‹ | Low | P0 |
| KLIF-1008 | Expand inventory and equipment - Add more mountaineering gear (ropes, harnesses, belay devices, quickdraws) with realistic weight/space constraints and functional gameplay effects | ðŸ“‹ | Medium | P1 |
| KLIF-1009 | Add natural hazards and events - Implement rockfalls, earthquakes, volcanic activity, strong winds as random events that affect health and require strategic responses | ðŸ“‹ | Medium | P2 |
